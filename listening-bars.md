# My Favorite Listening Bars
{:.thin}

These music bars, or listening bars, each plays really nice music, all located in Yokohama.


In playlists are musics that were played in that venue.

## LISTEN
{:.thin}


LISTEN is located on [Yoshidamachi Street](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%89%E7%94%B0%E7%94%BA_(%E6%A8%AA%E6%B5%9C%E5%B8%82%E4%B8%AD%E5%8C%BA)), which is approximately at the same distance from three stations: Sakuragicho, Kannai, and Hinodecho.

It features Okinawan spirits like Awamori, and plays music that makes you relax. "Relax" sounds a little bit commercialistic. I want to express by the word more soulful, deep meaning.

The bar master worked at [Music](https://barmusic-coffee.blogspot.com/) at Shibuya before he starts his own bar. The simple name came from his wish that all people that visit here would be able to listen to the sound equally.


Music played here includes [Kenny Rankin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8duOoYiBab4), James Blake, 

The music played here reminds you, calmly, that when you really listen to music, you would listen to yourself.

## Bonus:Down Beat
